This project is called BQE because I'm a big fan of
[TLAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym) and of NYC (which is also a TLA).
It could stand for "Backbone Q. Express" (look, it's hard to backronym "Q", ok?),
but it also uses MongoDB, Socket.IO, CoffeeScript, and plenty of other cool stuff.
It is not a framework but a structure for an MVC (hey, another TLA!) CRUD app.

To understand the motivation behind this project, start with this post by
[Harry Brundage](http://harry.me/2011/01/27/today-web-development-sucks/).

There are a number of strategies being used or planned for use which I will write about later.

To run:

`npm start`
