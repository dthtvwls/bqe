This project is called BQE because I love TLAs, and also NYC (hey, another TLA!)
It could also stand for "Backbone Q. Express" (look, it's hard backronyming "Q", ok?)

Why? Harry Brundage has already put it so well: http://harry.me/2011/01/27/today-web-development-sucks/

In short, I want both code and data to go between client and server as seamlessly as possible.

I use foreman (requires ruby) to run:

gem install foreman
foreman start
